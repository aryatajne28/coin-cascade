# Coin Cascade
## Idea
### My idea is to create a game like staking websites which gives certains coins to the users to start and you can play games with it that are totally luck based. So my game will be similar like you will be given certain coins, you tap and drop them from the top and they fall through the pegs into different slots, which gives multipliers randomly.

## Building

### Structure
- I am making a basic game area, which the user directly lands on.
- I found out that a Javascript library named p5.js is good for materials and physics, so that is what I am using here.

## Part 1 - Building the basic game
- After 4 hours of coding and some debugging the basic structure of the game is ready.
- Hereafter I am focusing on enhancing it, visually and gameplay wise
- Starting with - adding a tutorial on how to play the game.
